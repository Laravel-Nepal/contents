Hello, I am Anuj, a designer and developer with a passion for creating visually stunning and user-friendly digital experiences.

I have over 6 years of experience in Laravel and Vue.js. I have some laravel specific packages as well, most popular being [Laravel Nepali Date](https://anuzpandey.com/packages-plugins/laravel-nepali-date). You can check out my other packages on [My Website](https://anuzpandey.com/packages-plugins).

I love building web applications that are not only functional but also beautiful and intuitive.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with new technologies, or playing with/arranging my die-cast car collection.
