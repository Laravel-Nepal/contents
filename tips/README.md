# Tips

Short Laravel tips or snippets.

## File format
- One file per tip â†’ `slug.md`
- Use Frontmatter for metadata.

## Author guideline
- Profile of the package author(s) should be in the `authors/` folder.
- Use the `author` field to reference the author's `username` from the `authors/

## Image guideline
- Recommended size: 1200 x 630px (for social sharing)
- Place images in the `/images/tips` folder. The file name must be same as the `slug` field.
- If multiple images are needed for a tip, create a subfolder named after the slug and place images there.
